        <h2>How to make a birthday cake</h2>
        <p>Follow the step-by-step instructions and detailed ingredient list to create a fun birthday cake. Prep time will be around 30 minutes and cook time should take about 25 minutes. So it'll take less than an hour to create a birthday cake for someone special.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>4 eggs, separated and divided</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 pinches salt, divided</li> 
            <li>1 cup milk, room temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8 or 9 inch diameter cake pans.</li>
            <li>Cream sugar and butter in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg yolks,one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt together into a bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in three batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in a seperate bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into cake batter to lighten it; then gently fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip and a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
